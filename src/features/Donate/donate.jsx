          Aniston Life Foundation is a worldwide non-profit orphanage funding
          organization that are dedicated to looking for the welfare of
          abandoned children and orphans. We help orphans by providing health
          and educational opportunities, stable housing and adoption services.
          <br />
          <br />
          With the help of our charity program for orphans, weâ€™ve developed a
          number of orphanages, infant adoption centers, and schools in
          underserved parts of Philippines, India, Columbia and Africa with
          proper learning resources and tools.
          <br />
          <br />
          Help us donate to orphans and improve their living situations.
